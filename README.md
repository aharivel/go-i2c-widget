# I2C User-Space Drivers for Raspberry Pi Pico

This project leverages the [rp2040-i2c-interface](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/rp2040-i2c-interface) to facilitate communication with various I2C displays and sensors. By combining the Raspberry Pi Pico, the i2c-tiny-usb interface, and Linux, this program provides user-space drivers to interact with connected I2C devices.

> **Note:** This project is experimental, under active development, and intended primarily for learning purposes. Expect frequent changes and potential instability.

## Features

- **Integrates with i2c-tiny-usb**: Uses the I2C interface exposed by the Raspberry Pi Pico, programmed with the firmware from the [rp2040-i2c-interface](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/rp2040-i2c-interface) project.
- **User-Space Drivers**: Provides an easy-to-use set of Go-based user-space drivers for interacting with connected I2C devices.
- **Supported I2C Devices**:  
  - **OLED 128x64 Displays** (SSD1306)  
  - **OLED 128x128 Displays** (SH1107)  
  - **Temperature & Humidity Sensor** (SHT31)

## How It Works

1. **Flash the Pico**: Program the Raspberry Pi Pico with the [rp2040-i2c-interface](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/rp2040-i2c-interface) firmware to enable it as an I2C device.
2. **Connect I2C Devices**: Attach supported I2C devices (e.g., displays, sensors) to the Pico.
3. **Run This Program**: Use the user-space drivers provided by this project to interact with the connected I2C devices from Linux.
